- 👋 Hi, I’m Eugene, 30yo.
- 👀 Interested in making some useful things like bots for discord, telegram, games and different open source software.
- 🌱 Currently learning Rust. Working on some projects in Godot. Used to Python using it for automation routine stuff at work. Also peek at different languages and technologies, love to learn new stuff.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on game projects (little home hobby): GoDot or UE5.
- 📫 Idk why but you can find me in discord: @funapple
- 🔏 I use private repos playing with my projects
